Here I am posting versions of different Notebooks regarding NLP with different dataset

- Context

This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions. Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with “retailer”.

- Content
This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:

Clothing ID: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.

Age: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.

Title: String variable for the title of the review.

Review Text: String variable for the review body.
